#### Steps followed:
- **merge** airports and runways and create airport_run using the **ident column in airports**, and the **airport_ident column in runways**. We are doing a left join i.e. all of airports columns and only the matching values from runways will be imported.
- count the number of runways each airport has. Here we will **group the rows** based on the **common airport_ident** values while keep a **count of the non-null values in id_y** which has the runway entries of a particular airport.
- create a **new dataset containing airport iata code, type of airport, elevation of airport, and the number of runways**. All of which could play a role in delays.
- **add info about the AirportFrom** values by combining the airlines and air_run datasets based on the AirportFrom and iata_code columns, this would give us the **count of runways, elevation, and iata_code of the airports from where flights take off**. Something that could be a factor in delays. 
- **add similar info about the destination airports**. This would also be a factor in flights delays. For eg: if the destination airport has only one runway, flights would have to park themselves and wait for their turn to land resulting in delays. But this time we will use combined_data instead of airlines since we have all the info from airlines dataset from previous steps. 
- As is with every profession, the amount of experience we have plays an important role in our performance. Applying that logic to airline delays, let's **extract experience info about each airline in our dataset** from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airlines_of_the_United_States" using Beautiful Soup class from bs4 and requests lib.
- Apart from the experience, the traffic of the airport is also a factor in delays. If your source/destination airport sees a lot of traffic, naturally the take-off and landing times will be affected. For this step, **we will extract info from** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_United_States But this wikipedia page was updated recently, so I am **using a previous version of the wikipedia page of 13 April 2023** from this URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_United_States&oldid=1149689977
- Collate the dataset into combined_data_traffic: ultimate dataset with all the relevant info from previous tables.
- Treat missing values:

- For type, elevation_ft, and runway_count values, we will find the relevant info for 'CYS' i.e 'Cheyenne Regional Jerry Olson Field' from previous datasets and add them to the combined_data_traffic dataset.
- We will remove the iata_code columns for source and destination airport since the AirportFrom and AirportTo columns have the same info. 
- For Founded column we can extract the information about the founding year of airlines (US, EV, and CO) from the internet and add the values in the missing rows. 
- For traffic data 2021 of source and destination airports, we will first impute missing values with the median() value of the airport. And remove the remaining left after the process.
